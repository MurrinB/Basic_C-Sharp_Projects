# Basic_C-Sharp_Projects
These are some of the small projects I made while using C# and .Net Framework

## <a href="https://github.com/MurrinB/Basic_C-Sharp_Projects/tree/main/Assignments/BLackjackGame">Blackjack Game</a>

This project is a console application written in C# that utilizes a C# Library built by me called Casino. The Casino library 
gives a foundation for any card game. With classes like Dealer, Deck, Player and Game. This application also uses a SQL Database
for logging of exceptions, to know what exceptions occur and when they occur. With the use of a Guid for player identification and use of StreamWriter
to save player information and display the database.

## <a href="https://github.com/MurrinB/Basic_C-Sharp_Projects/tree/main/MVC/CarInsurance">Car Insurance App</a>

This project is an MVC we application that is similar to an insurance website. It takes users input to calculate a quote based on business logic.
This project includes an admin page for website manager to view all applicants and the quotes given.
